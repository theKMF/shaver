#Let's recreate the first wave of smart phone novelty apps, except as Webb Apps

Back in the way back when, before the turn of the millenium even, I started teching myself how to code. I used a now exstinct language called Lingo in the Macromedia made Director IDE. After some inital stumblings in random crap I started recreating old arcade classicss. PONG, Astroids and Break Out. 

By doing that I learned a lot.

Now I want to learn more about PWAs so I decided to take a similar route and make copies of the first wave of novelty apps. 

##Why on earth would you do such a thing?
Simple really, the first batch of apps all focuse on showing off the new features that phones enabled with their sensor array and multi touch input. They are also small well defined cases so should be OK:

THis is the first one, the app that turns your phone into a shaver. 

* Better design
* Off-line
* Time the sound and the vibration better
* Trim (hahah LOL trim... it's a TRIMMER lololol DO U GEDDIT?!) the length of the sound
